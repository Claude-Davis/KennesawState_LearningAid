/* # FUNCTION STACK (aka CALL STACK)
        - A data structure used to manage function calls. Trackswhich method is currently running and what happens when it is completed.

    ## Visualization / The Order of the Stack
        1. Each newly called method is stacked on top of the previously called method.
        2. As the method finishes, it is removed from the stack until the stack becomes empty.

    ## LIFO (Last In, First Out)
        - LIFO describes the order at which information travels
