prompt: The table below contains a collection of details about a research project
        you have just completed on rising sea levels. Imagine that you are writing
        documents for each of the 5 following audiences:
            - Your supervisor/boss
            - Scientists
            - The general public
            - Politicians
            - High school students
        What information about rising sea levels might each audience be interested
        in? As you go down the list, consider which detail would be most interesting
        and relevant to each audience.

Categories of Information:
    - The dollar damage caused by sea level increases each year.
    - A literature review of previous research on rising sea levels.
    - Descriptions of calibration procedures for your instruments.
    - Some basic physics of how tides and currents work.
    - How much your project costs.
    - A log of all your measurements during the whole project.
    - A list of people who worked on the project.
    - Specifications of a new instrument to measure water conditions.
    - A new result showing a connection between sea level and coastal developments.
    - Procedures you used to avoid statistical biases in your data.
    - Your plans for further measurements.
    - Your recommendations for future research.
