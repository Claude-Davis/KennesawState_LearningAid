prompt: Think of a problem or an “unsatisfactory situation” that you have recently experienced.
        Use Hymen’s Problem Formulation schema to formally define the problem — without proposing
        any particular solutions. Your problem definition should ideally allow multiple possible
        solutions that adhere to the following:
            -Need/Unsatisfactory situation:
            -What is your goal?
            -What are some measurable objectives you want to achieve?
            -What are your constraints?
