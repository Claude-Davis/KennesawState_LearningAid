OPERATORS IN JAVA: Logical and Mathematical

Logical Operators
      ||     Like "or" in Python; evaluates which one of multiple conditions is true
      &&     Like "and" in Python; evaluates if all of the given conditions are true
      !      Like "not" in Python; evaluates if a condition is false

Mathematical (and Increment/Decrement) Operators
      +      Addition
      -      Subtraction

      ++<variable_name>     Increases value by 1 prior to printing
      <variable_name>++     Increase value by 1 after printing
      --<variable_name>     Decreases value by 1 prior to printing
      <variable_name>--     Decreases value by 1 after printing

      *      Multiplication
      /      Division
      %      Modulo

* For EXPONATION and FLOOR DIVISION Java requires you to import methods
      Math.pow(base_number, exponent)          Exponents
      Math.floorDiv(first_num, second_num)     Floor Division
