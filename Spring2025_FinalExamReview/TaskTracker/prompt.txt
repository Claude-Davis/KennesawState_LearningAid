GOAL: build your own version of a LinkedList to keep track of tasks in the order that they are added.

FEATURES:
 - add tasks 
 - remove the first task
 - view all tasks
 - check if the list is empty

REQUIRED CLASSES:
 - Task
    * represents a to-do item
    * fields: String description, int taskId, int nextId
    * methods: constructor, toString()
 - TaskList
    * your custom singly linked list
    * fields: Node head (keeps track of the first task), int size
    *** inner Node class
         - Task data
         - Node next;
    * methods:
         - void addTask(Task t) : add task to end of the list
         - Task removeTask() : remove first task and return item
         - void printTasks()
         - boolean isEmpty



PRACTICE FOCUS:
* Learn how nodes connect and move.

* Practice basic traversal (walking through the list).

* Understand head pointer changes when removing.

* Build confidence working with classes and objects.


SAMPLE OUTPUT:
        Added Task #1: "Do laundry"
        Added Task #2: "Finish homework"
        Added Task #3: "Call Mom"

        All tasks:
        Task #1: Do laundry
        Task #2: Finish homework
        Task #3: Call Mom

        Removed Task: Task #1: Do laundry

        Remaining tasks:
        Task #2: Finish homework
        Task #3: Call Mom
