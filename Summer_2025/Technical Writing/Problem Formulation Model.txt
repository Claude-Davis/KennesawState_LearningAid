Barry Hyman’s Problem Formulation Model:

1. Need Statement: recognizes and describes the need for a solution or improvement
    to an “unsatisfactory situation.”  It answers the questions, “what is wrong with
    the way things are currently? What is unsatisfactory about it? What negative effects
    does this situation cause?” You may need to do research and supply data to quantify
    the negative effects.

2. Goal Statement:  describes what the improved situation would look like once a solution
    has been implemented. The goal statement defines the scope of your search for a solution.
    At this point, do not describe your solution, only the goal that any proposed solution should
    achieve. The broader you make your goal, the more numerous and varied your solutions can be; a
    narrowly focused goal limits the number and variety of possible solutions.

3. Objectives: define measurable, specific outcomes that any feasible solution should optimize (aspects
    you can use to “grade” the effectiveness of the solution). Objectives provide you with ways to
    quantifiably measure how well any solution will solve the problem; ideally, they will allow you to
    compare multiple solutions and figure out which one is most effective (which one gets the highest score
    on meeting the objectives?).

4. Constraints: define the limits that any feasible solution must adhere to in order to be acceptable (pass/fail
    conditions, range limits, etc.). The key word here is must — constraints are the “go/no go” conditions that
    determine whether a solution is acceptable or not.  These often include budget and time limits, as well as legal,
    safety and other regulatory requirements.
