PREWRITING..
     This stage is for generating ideas, understanding
     the ideas of others, and collecting information
     (note taking, free-writing, brainstorming, looping).

PLANNING..
    Here, you are organizing and focusing ideas. This may
    involve mind mapping, clustering, listing, and creating
    outlines.

DRAFTING..
    In the drafting stage you are writing initial drafts of a
    text focusing mainly on the development, organization, and
    elaboration of ideas.

REFLECTION..
    In the reflection stage, you can let the work sit and come
    back to it at a later point. You may cycle back between
    drafting a reflection a number of times before moving on.

PEER REVIEW..
    Now you can get feedback from others. This may require you
    to return to the drafting and reflecting stages.

REVISION..
    Here you are further developing and clarifying ideas and the
    structure of the text. This may require you to return to the
    drafting and reflecting stages. If the work requires additional
    research or idea generation, return to the planning stage.

EDITING & PROOFREADING..
    Here the focus is on surface-level features of the text.
