Constructive communication promotes mutual understanding and respect
between the writer(s) and author(s) of the document. Constructive
communication, also, helps the reader(s) to feel empowered or a sense
of belonging.

Sometimes, you will need to communicate information that is unpleasant,
such as delivering bad news or rejecting a request. Communicating
constructively is possible—and arguably even more important—in these
situations. Regardless of the message, how can you ensure you are
communicating constructively?

* Adopt an adult-to-adult approach: Avoid talking down to your reader(s)
    in a patronizing tone.Aim to communicate respectfully, responsibly,
    confidently and cooperattively.

* Be courteous: Focus on the reader. Use "you" unless it assigns blame to
    the reader(s) (one effective use of passive verbs is to avoid assigning
    blame: “mistakes were made”). Use traditionally accepted forms of courtesy
    and politeness. Use gender-neutral phrasing and plural forms, unless you
    are referring to a specific person and you know their gender.

* Focus on the positive: Emphasize what you can do rather than what you can’t.
    Try to avoid negative wording and phrasing. Focus on what can be improved.

* Be genuine: Apologize if you have made a mistake. Take responsibility and
    promise to do better. Be authentic in your expression. Avoid sounding like
    marketing material (ad-speak). Make reasonable claims that can be backed
    with evidence.
