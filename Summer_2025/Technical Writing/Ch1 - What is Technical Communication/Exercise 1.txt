prompt: Write a paragraph or two on a topic about which you have specialized knowledge,
        and can use specialized terminology to explain the idea or instruct the reader.
        Consider your audience when choosing how to write this. Will the audience have
        to be familiar with the terminology used? See if you can write a paragraph that
        can “baffle me with your techno-jargon,” and then re-write for a general audience,
        using plain language.
